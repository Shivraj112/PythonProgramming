#Python code to print "Hello World"
# print("Hello, World!")

my_variable = 10        #Python knows this is a number
my_variable = "Hello"   #Now Python knows it's a word


# Printing Multiple Lines

print("WELCOME TO PYTHON.")
print("Let's start coding.")  # Each print() function prints separate line.


# Printing on the same line

print("Hello,",end=" ")
print("World!")   # By default print() ends with newline, 
                    #but by using end=" ", You will tell python to end with a space instead of new line.
