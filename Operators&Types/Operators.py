# Arithmetic operators are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus

# 1. Arithmetic operation

number_of_samosas = 5
price_per_samosa = 10
total_earnings = number_of_samosas * price_per_samosa
print("Total Earning from samosas:", total_earnings) 

# 2. Comparison Operators - Compare values

my_samosas = 5
shiva_samosas = 7
print("Did Shiva make more samosas than me?", shiva_samosas > my_samosas)

# 3. Logical Operators 

age = 20
has_pass = True
can_enter = age > 18 and has_pass
print("Can Ramesh enter the club?", can_enter)

# 4. Assignment Operators

total_earnings = 50
total_earnings += 30 # total_earning = total_earnings + 30
print("Total earnings after two days: ", total_earnings)


# 5. Bitwise operators

A = 1 #ON
B = 0 #OFF
result = A & B # both need to be ON for result to be 1
print("Are both switches ON?", result)
